# Simulated-Network-Traffic-Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Python.
This project implements a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python. It simulates network traffic and classifies it as either normal or potentially malicious. The IDS uses a machine learning model to detect attacks based on the source and destination IP addresses. The project demonstrates key concepts in network security and machine learning, providing insight into how intrusion detection systems analyze and categorize network activity.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebook
